<p class="p1">Environmental awareness is the understanding of how our actions affect the environment and the 
importance of protecting it. It involves being informed about environmental issues such as climate change,
deforestation,and pollution.<br>
Environmental awareness is important because of the many environmental challenges the world faces, including:
climate change, deforestation, droughts, floods, global warming, water scarcity, and pollution.This awareness
can lead to the adoption of sustainable practices in daily life and in organizations. 
These practices include: reducing energy consumption, implementing waste management systems, adopting sustain-
able procurement practices, and promoting responsible water usage.<br>
Environmental education is an important part of environmental awareness and can help promote environmental 
literacy and protect natural resources. Environmental clubs can also help create environmental awareness by 
enabling members to participate in environmental activities. Digital storytelling can also be used to raise
awareness about the importance of protecting the environment.<br>
